# Most-Simple-Ui-Library-Ever

Usage is put ui library before script yeah 

I don't wanna upload an documentation because it's a simple ui library that i made for my jojo script (which won't be released)

Here an example

library:CreateWindow()
library:JojoButton("abc", function()
	
    print("hi")

end)
library:JojoToggle("abc",function(a)

    print(a)
end)
